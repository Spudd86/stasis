/**
 * clock.c
 *
 * @file Implementation of the CLOCK buffer replacement algorithm.
 *
 * This replacement policy keeps a pointer "ptr" to the array of pages
 * that back the buffer manager, which it treats as a circular buffer.
 * It sweeps ptr over the array of pages, marking "hot" pages as "cold",
 * and returning "cold" pages for eviction.  It increments ptr one slot
 * each time getStaleAndRemove is called.  When pages are "hit", it marks
 * them "hot", regardless of their prior state.
 *
 * This module also maintains p->pinCount in the obvious way so that it does
 * not evict pages that have been pinned by the calling thread.
 *
 * This module does not use mutexes, and instead uses atomic instructions
 * such as test and set.
 *
 * States (Stored in p->queue):
 *
 * Page pinning:  [-1, 0, 1] -> remove -> insert -> 1
 * Get stale and remove:  [1] -> [0].  [0] -> [-1] -> insert -> [1].  [-1] -> [-1]
