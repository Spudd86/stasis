LLADD is an experimental Lightweight Library for Atomicity and Durability of Data.

Please see the COPYING file for licensing information.  

To build, do:

./configure
make
make check
make install

To build the API and internals documentation, run:

make docs

after configure.

'make check' requires the GNU check library, 'make doc' requires Doxygen.

We haven't tested make install. ;)

This package contains a copy of Peter Graf's Program Base Library, PBL, which is
distributed under the terms of the LGPL.

The original version can be found at:

http://mission.base.com/peter/source/

LLADD's version of the package adds the jbhash.* files, and compiles PBL using
LLADD's make files.  Currently, LLADD's hash table implementations are based upon
code from PBL, and pbl is used in a number of places throughout LLADD.
